# üõ†Ô∏è Code Refactoring Roadmap (Post-MVP)

_A concise, phased plan to eliminate duplication, enforce DRY principles, and prepare the Gigavibe codebase for long-term scalability.  All changes begin **after MVP user testing** and will be executed in non-breaking feature branches._

---

## üîé Background

Internal review surfaced clusters of duplicated logic that increase maintenance cost:

‚Ä¢ **Challenge domain** ‚Äì two independent `ChallengeService` implementations  
‚Ä¢ **Audio domain** ‚Äì four overlapping playback/recording services + scattered hooks  
‚Ä¢ **API layer** ‚Äì `ApiService` _and_ `fetcher.ts` wrap fetch separately  
‚Ä¢ **Hooks** ‚Äì `useChallenge` vs `useUnifiedChallenge`, multiple audio hooks repeating logic  
‚Ä¢ **File layout** ‚Äì services split between `src/services/` and `src/lib/` with no clear rule  

The roadmap below resolves these issues while aligning with existing architecture guidelines (modular, service-oriented, TypeScript-first).

## üìÖ Phased Implementation

| Phase | Goal | Key Tasks | Duration* |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|
| **1. Inventory & Test Coverage** | Freeze behaviour before refactor | ‚Ä¢ Catalogue runtime usages of duplicated modules<br>‚Ä¢ Add snapshot/unit tests around public APIs of duplicated services & hooks | 1 week |
| **2. Service Consolidation** | Single source of truth per domain | ‚Ä¢ Select canonical implementation (e.g. keep `src/services/ChallengeService.ts`)<br>‚Ä¢ Merge features from secondary versions into canonical file<br>‚Ä¢ Deprecate superseded files with TODO banner | 1-2 weeks |
| **3. Hook Unification** | Remove overlapping state logic | ‚Ä¢ Collapse `useChallenge` into `useUnifiedChallenge`<br>‚Ä¢ Merge audio-related hooks into `useAudioPlayback`, `useAudioRecording`, `useAudioAnalysis` | 1 week |
| **4. Directory Re-org** | Clear, predictable structure | ```
src/
  services/        # all domain services
    audio/
    challenge/
    api/
  hooks/
    audio/
    challenges/
  utils/
  types/
``` |
| **5. API Layer DRY-ing** | One HTTP wrapper | ‚Ä¢ Fold `fetcher.ts` logic into `ApiService` (or vice-versa)<br>‚Ä¢ Export typed helper: `api.fetch<T>(endpoint, opts)` | 2-3 days |
| **6. Gradual Migration** | Swap imports safely | ‚Ä¢ Provide codemod scripts / eslint rule to forbid old paths<br>‚Ä¢ Update imports module-by-module, run test suite | 1-2 weeks |
| **7. Hardening & Cleanup** | Remove deprecated files | ‚Ä¢ Delete deprecated services/hooks after green CI<br>‚Ä¢ Final lint pass & documentation updates | 2-3 days |

_*Rough estimates; adjust based on team capacity._

## üß© Non-Functional Requirements

1. **No Breaking Changes Before GA** ‚Äì refactor branches stay behind a feature flag or are merged only after MVP feedback is incorporated.  
2. **Automated Tests Required** ‚Äì every consolidated module must reach baseline coverage before deleting duplicates.  
3. **CI Gates** ‚Äì lint, type-check, unit + integration tests must pass on each phase branch.  
4. **Documentation** ‚Äì update `docs/Technical.md` + component READMEs per phase.

---

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done

- Zero duplicate domain services or hooks in `main`
- All modules live in the agreed directory structure
- API surface documented in `/docs/Technical.md`
- Test coverage ‚â• previous baseline
- Developer onboarding time reduced (subjective survey)

---

## ‚úã Next Steps

1. Maintain this roadmap in sync with `docs/Roadmap.md` milestones.  
2. Open **`refactor/phase-1-inventory`** branch once MVP feedback window closes.  
3. Track progress via GitHub project board **‚ÄúDRY Refactor‚Äù**.

Together these steps will keep the codebase **clean, modular, and performant** as Gigavibe scales beyond the MVP.
