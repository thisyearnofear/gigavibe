# 🔧 SERVICE CONSOLIDATION ANALYSIS

## Challenge Services Comparison:

### src/services/ChallengeService.ts (UnifiedChallengeService)
- **Lines**: 285+ 
- **Features**: Full challenge management, API integration, filtering, results
- **Usage**: Used by useUnifiedChallenge hook
- **Architecture**: Implements ChallengeServiceInterface
- **Status**: ✅ KEEP - More comprehensive

### src/lib/challenges/ChallengeService.ts (ChallengeService) 
- **Lines**: 143
- **Features**: Basic song management, default challenges
- **Usage**: ❌ NOT IMPORTED ANYWHERE
- **Architecture**: Simple class with basic methods
- **Status**: 🗑️ DELETE - Redundant

## Consolidation Plan:
1. ✅ Keep src/services/ChallengeService.ts (more feature-complete)
2. 🗑️ Delete src/lib/challenges/ChallengeService.ts (unused)
3. 🔄 Merge any unique features if needed
4. 📝 Update imports (already correct)

## Audio Services Analysis Needed:
- Multiple AudioRecordingService implementations
- AudioServiceManager (1,389 lines - needs splitting)
- Multiple audio hooks with overlapping functionality
